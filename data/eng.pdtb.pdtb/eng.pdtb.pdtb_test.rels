Mr. Sweig said he estimated that Lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20 % , largely because of the performance of its new anti-depressant Prozac .

The company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins . The company 's lean operation , analysts said , allowed sharp-rising sales from its cholesterol drug , Lopid , to power earnings growth . Lopid sales are expected to be about $ 300 million this year , up from $ 190 million in 1988 . In Morris Plains , N.J. , a spokesman for the company said the analysts ' projections are " in the ballpark . " Squibb 's profit , estimated by analysts to be about 18 % above the $ 123 million , or $ 1.25 a share , it earned in the third quarter of 1988 , was the result of especially strong sales of its Capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease . The company was officially merged with Bristol-Myers Co. earlier this month . Bristol-Myers declined to comment . Mr. Riccardo of Bear Stearns said that Schering-Plough Corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18 % to 20 % , and Bristol-Meyers 's expected profit increase of about 13 % are largely because " those companies are really managed well .
