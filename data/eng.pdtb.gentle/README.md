### Repository for the DISRPT version of the Genre Tests for Linguistic Evaluation (GENTLE) Corpus - PDTB-style annotations

This repository contains DISRPT format versions of the Genre Tests for Linguistic Evaluation (GENTLE) corpus, an English out-of-domain test set following the same multilayer annotations found in the [GUM corpus](https://gucorpling.org/gum/). The texts are of the following 8 genres:

  * dictionary entries
  * live esports commentary
  * legal documents
  * medical notes
  * poetry
  * mathematical proofs
  * course syllabuses
  * threat letters

The data is annotated using Enhanced Rhetorical Structure Theory (eRST), as described in [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/2025.cl-1.3/). Data is annotated in the enhanced RST (eRST) formalism, described in [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/2025.cl-1.3/). While eRST annotations are contained in the folder `data/eng.erst.gentle/`, this folder contains PDTB-style connective annotations for the connective detection task, as described in [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.684/).

## Splits - test only

The entire corpus is designed to be a *test set* of challenging genres for NLP systems to be evaluated on. Although one can train a model on this corpus, or concatenate it to another training set, we present this entire corpus as a test set, and do not provide any official train / dev data.

### Notes on Connectives

GENTLE guidelines follow PDTB v3 guidelines for the identification of connectives and relation types (explicit, implicit, altlex, etc.), but excludes open-class lexical modifiers of connectives. As a result, the string "six months later" may be considered a connective in eng.pdtb.pdtb, but in eng.pdtb.gentle only the word "later" will be annotated as a connective.

Also note that the `.conllu` data contains some reconstructed ellipsis tokens with 
decimal IDs (e.g. 12.1); these do not appear in the other formats and are ignored in token 
index spans.
