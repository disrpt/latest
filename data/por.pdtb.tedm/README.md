# TED MDB Annotations

TED-Multilingual Discourse Bank is a multilingual resource where TED-talks are annotated at the discourse level in 6 languages (English, Polish, German, Russian, European Portuguese, and Turkish) following the aims and principles of PDTB. 

## DISRPT 2023 Shared Task Information

Three of the six parts are integrated here for the surprise dataset release : English, Portuguese and Turkish.

The dataset only contains a `dev` and `test` partition, without a `train` partition. 
This dataset thus corresponds to an Out of Domain setting: 
participants have to produce a system based on other data.

Tokenization was given. Sentence splits was made manually. POS tagging, and syntactic parsing were obtained with Stanza.
