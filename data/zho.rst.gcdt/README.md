### GCDT: Georgetown Chinese Discourse Treebank 

More information at: https://github.com/logan-siyao-peng/GCDT

## Introduction

GCDT is the largest (as of October 2022) hierarchical discourse treebank for Mandarin Chinese in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). 

GCDT covers over 60K tokens across five genres of freely available text, using the same relation inventory as the contemporary RST treebank for English -- [GUM](https://github.com/amir-zeldes/gum). 

The corpus contains 50 documents, 10 from each of the five genres below.

In total, there are 62,905 tokens and  9,717 EDUs. The label set contains 32 discourse relations.

A `train`/`dev`/`test` split is given, with a 8:1:1 proportion based on genre.


## DISRPT 2023 Shared Task Information

Tokenization, sentence segmentation, POS tagging and syntactic dependency parses are made available using Stanza.

In this paper, we present GCDT, the largest hierarchical discourse treebank for Mandarin Chinese in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). GCDT covers over 60K tokens across five genres of freely available text, using the same relation inventory as contemporary RST treebanks for English. We also report on this dataset's parsing experiments, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) scores for Chinese RST parsing and RST parsing on the English GUM dataset, using cross-lingual training in Chinese and English with multilingual embeddings.},

	abstract = {This document provides extensive guidelines and examples for Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) annotation in Mandarin Chinese. The guideline is divided into three sections. We first introduce preprocessing steps to prepare data for RST annotation. Secondly, we discuss syntactic criteria to segment texts into Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs). Lastly, we provide examples to define and distinguish discourse relations in different genres. We hope that this reference manual can facilitate RST annotations in Chinese and accelerate the development of the RST framework across languages.},
