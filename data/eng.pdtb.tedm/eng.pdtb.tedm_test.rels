But let 's move yet again ten times further away . Here we are out at the Oort Cloud , outside the solar system , and we 're starting to see the sun move into the field of view and get into where the planet is . One more time , ten times further away . Now we 're at Alpha Centauri , our nearest neighbor star , and the planet is gone . All we 're seeing is the big beaming image of the star that's ten billion times brighter than the planet , which should be in that little red circle . That's what we want to see . That's why it's hard . The light from the star is diffracting . It's scattering inside the telescope , creating that very bright image that washes out the planet . So to see the planet , we have to do something about all of that light . We have to get rid of it . I have a lot of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do that , but I want to tell you about one today that I think is the coolest , and probably the most likely to get us an Earth in the next decade . It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer , the father of the space telescope , in 1962 , and he took his inspiration from an eclipse . You've all seen that . That's a solar eclipse . The moon has moved in front of the sun . It blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it . It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up and blocked that spotlight that's getting right in my eye , I can see you in the back row . Well , what's going on ? Well the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth . We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow , we look back at the sun , and most of the light's been removed and we can see that dim , fine structure in the corona . Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space . We build a big screen , we fly it in space , we put it up in front of the star , we block out most of the light , we fly a space telescope in that shadow that's created , and boom , we get to see planets . Well that would look something like this . So there's that big screen , and there's no planets , because unfortunately it doesn't actually work very well , because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope . It's like water bending around a rock in a stream , and all that light just destroys the shadow . It's a terrible shadow . And we can't see planets . But Spitzer actually knew the answer . If we can feather the edges , soften those edges so we can control diffraction , well then we can see a planet , and in the last 10 years or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing that . It looks something like that . We call that our flower petal starshade . If we make the edges of those petals exactly right , if we control their shape , we can control diffraction , and now we have a great shadow . It's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before , and we can see the planets beam out just like that . That , of course , has to be bigger than my thumb . That starshade is about the size of half a football field and it has to fly 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held right in its shadow , and then we can see those planets . This sounds formidable , but brilliant engineers , colleagues of mine at JPL , came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this . It starts wrapped around a hub . It separates from the telescope . The petals unfurl , they open up , the telescope turns around . Then you'll see it flip and fly out that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope . It's going to move in front of the star just like that , creates a wonderful shadow . Boom , we get planets orbiting about it . ( Applause ) Thank you . That's not science fiction . We've been working on this for the last five or six years . Last summer , we did a really cool test out in California at Northrop Grumman . So those are four petals . This is a sub-scale star shade . It's about half the size of the one you just saw . You'll see the petals unfurl . Those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at JPL . Now you 're seeing it deploy . Those petals have to rotate into place . The base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter . We ran this test 16 times , and 16 times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter . This has to be done very precisely , but if we can do this , if we can build this technology , if we can get it into space , you might see something like this . That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the Hubble Space Telescope . If we can take a similar space telescope , slightly larger , put it out there , fly an occulter in front of it , what we might see is something like that -- that's a family portrait of our solar system -- but not ours . We 're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system as seen through an occulter , through a starshade like that . You can see Jupiter , you can see Saturn , Uranus , Neptune , and right there in the center , next to the residual light is that pale blue dot . That's Earth . We want to see that , see if there's water , oxygen , ozone , the things that might tell us that it could harbor life . I think this is the coolest possible science . That's why I got into doing this , because I think that will change the world . That will change everything when we see that . Thank you .	319-326	327-337	Now it 's not resolved at all .

We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow , we look back at the sun , and most of the light's been removed and we can see that dim , fine structure in the corona . Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space . We build a big screen , we fly it in space , we put it up in front of the star , we block out most of the light , we fly a space telescope in that shadow that's created , and boom , we get to see planets . Well that would look something like this . So there's that big screen , and there's no planets , because unfortunately it doesn't actually work very well , because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope . It's like water bending around a rock in a stream , and all that light just destroys the shadow . It's a terrible shadow . And we can't see planets . But Spitzer actually knew the answer . If we can feather the edges , soften those edges so we can control diffraction , well then we can see a planet , and in the last 10 years or so we've come up with optimal solutions for doing that . It looks something like that . We call that our flower petal starshade . If we make the edges of those petals exactly right , if we control their shape , we can control diffraction , and now we have a great shadow . It's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before , and we can see the planets beam out just like that . That , of course , has to be bigger than my thumb . That starshade is about the size of half a football field and it has to fly 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held right in its shadow , and then we can see those planets . This sounds formidable , but brilliant engineers , colleagues of mine at JPL , came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this . It starts wrapped around a hub . It separates from the telescope . The petals unfurl , they open up , the telescope turns around . Then you'll see it flip and fly out that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope . It's going to move in front of the star just like that , creates a wonderful shadow . Boom , we get planets orbiting about it . ( Applause ) Thank you . That's not science fiction . We've been working on this for the last five or six years . Last summer , we did a really cool test out in California at Northrop Grumman . So those are four petals . This is a sub-scale star shade . It's about half the size of the one you just saw . You'll see the petals unfurl . Those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at JPL . Now you 're seeing it deploy . Those petals have to rotate into place . The base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter . We ran this test 16 times , and 16 times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter . This has to be done very precisely , but if we can do this , if we can build this technology , if we can get it into space , you might see something like this . That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the Hubble Space Telescope . If we can take a similar space telescope , slightly larger , put it out there , fly an occulter in front of it , what we might see is something like that -- that's a family portrait of our solar system -- but not ours . We 're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system as seen through an occulter , through a starshade like that . You can see Jupiter , you can see Saturn , Uranus , Neptune , and right there in the center , next to the residual light is that pale blue dot . That's Earth . We want to see that , see if there's water , oxygen , ozone , the things that might tell us that it could harbor life . I think this is the coolest possible science . That's why I got into doing this , because I think that will change the world . That will change everything when we see that . Thank you .
