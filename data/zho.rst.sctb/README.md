Although there are some automatic translation systems that benefit the learning of both languages, there is enough space to create resources in order to help language learners. As a quick and effective resource that can give large amount language information, corpus-based learning is becoming more and more popular. In this paper we enrich a Spanish-Chinese parallel corpus automatically with part of-speech (POS) information and manually with discourse segmentation (following the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988)). Two search tools allow the Spanish-Chinese language learners to carry out different queries based on tokens and lemmas. The parallel corpus and the research tools are available to the academic community. We propose some examples to illustrate how learners can use the corpus to learn Spanish and Chinese.",

## Introduction

The RST Spanish-Chinese Treebank is a corpus of specialized texts in Spanish and their parallel texts in Chinese. All the texts are annotated manually with discourse relations under the theoretical framework Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988). RSTTool (O’Donnell, 2000) is used to annotate this corpus. The annotation results are saved by rstWeb (Zeldes, 2016). 

In total, 100 texts are included in this corpus. The genres of these texts are: (a) scientific abstract; (b) advertisement; (c) news and (d) announcement. The topics of the corpus are: (a) terminology; (b) culture; (c) language; (d) economy; (e) education; (f) art and (g) international affairs.

## DISRPT 2023 Shared Task Information

Automatic parses were added using Stanza's Simplified Chinese model trained on UD_Chinese-GSD (`gsdsimp`). Some tokenization and parsing errors are expected. This dataset contains discontinuous discourse units (split 'same-unit').
